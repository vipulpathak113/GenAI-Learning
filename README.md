# Generative AI


**Generative AI:**

Generative AI is a type of AI that can create new content, such as text, images, music, audio, and videos. It's powered by large AI models, called foundation models, that can perform a variety of tasks, including summarization, Q&A, and classification.

**Prompt Engineering:**

Prompt engineering is a critical aspect of working with language models (LMs), such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). It involves crafting the input text (the prompt) in a way that effectively guides the Language Models towards generating the desired output (the completion). This process can sometimes require multiple iterations of refinement to achieve the best results, a practice known as prompt engineering.

**Key Concepts in Language Model Interaction:**
- Prompt: The input text provided to the model.
- Inference: The process of generating text based on the prompt.
- Completion: The output text produced by the model.

**Context Window:**
The context window refers to the total amount of text that the model can consider at one time. It is a critical factor since it limits the amount of information that can be used for generating responses.
